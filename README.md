# OU Food Bank Inventory System

This repository contains ENGR 1411-004 Team 9's Inventory Management System. This is where the developers will change any coding in the program.

In order to access and import the system into your Visual Studio Code, you must be invited into this GitHub repository by one of the developers (if you're reading this, you've already completed that task). You must then copy either the HTTPS or SSH link of the repository (which can be found by clicking the green "Code" button at the top right corner) and type ``>Git: clone`` followed by the requested URL/link of the desired repository in Visual Studio Code.
> **NOTE:** in order for this task to correctly compile and work, you must have a "Git" software installed in your computer (you can look for a Git in Visual Studio Code's Extensions tab or any JAVA-SUPPORTED (until further notice) software located at the Internet.
>
> One example that I (JP) am using can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You may be asked to choose the destination of the repository, in which case you may insert it into an easily accesible location. Once you've imported the repository into your IDE (aka Visual Studio Code), you can find the programs in development under ``OUFB_Inventory_System`` > ``src``, where all the classes will appear.

From here you are able to add, remove, and/or change any necessary classes and/or methods.
>**NOTE**: These changes must be agreed upon and approved by the development team either explicitly (e.g. wanting to change a major section of a class/method) or implicitly (debugging, code tweaking, etc.).

Whenever you have completed your work, you **MUST** commit and push your code into this repository
1. **SAVE** your changed code (``File`` > ``Save``)
   - OR, under ``OPEN EDITORS``, click the small Save button.
3. On the left side of your screen, click on the Source Control.
4. If there was little improvement of the code, it may ask to "commit all changes". Click yes.
5. Inside the Message bar, this is where you will document any changes to the repository. You should document all of your edits (preferably with a brief explanation, unless implicitly acknowledgeable)
   > Documentation should start at the top of the file with "New Update pushed by <your name>:"
6. When finished, go to the blue "Commit" button, click on the arrow next to it, and select "Commit & Push".
  - You may be told that changes are unstaged. Click yes.

If done properly, after refreshing this GitHub page, you will see your change on the top of the website.

For further explanation on this concept, go through this resource:
- How to commit and push to GitHub: [here](https://www.jcchouinard.com/create-your-first-github-project-in-vscode/#:~:text=To%20push%20code%20from%20Visual,if%20you%20haven%27t%20already.)

Until further notice, the system will be using Java as the main language (as a quick and easy, universal language); however, if needed or preferred by the development team, the program can be reverted to Python. The following are resources to assist with learning Java:
- A long, tedious, but very informative Java tutorial video: [here](https://youtu.be/xk4_1vDrzzo?si=8IULJtnpM-_2R13X)
- A YouTube playlist with shorter videos on Java concepts: [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7pe_IiTfNyr55kwJPWbgxB5&si=8lj3W7Afe4OefMsy)
- A playlist for Python coders: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeCw4yncc6E&list=PLiwphLky56kA0uz5G3pR9VVrL1rNZsfOr)
- Comparison between Java & Python: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emNkJGwcusQ)
- And, of course, AI can help you.

## Visual Studio Code's Live Share Sessions

Should the development team require a collaboration session, VSCode's **Live Share** extension can be installed in your IDE. The verified developer should be Microsoft.

Once you've installed the extension, you can either create a collaboration session for you and the developers or join a collaboration through a link that the creator should have shared with you (if you are the creator, you must copy the session link and paste it through the team's shared Google Doc.
>**NOTE**: Live Share does **not** save any changes within the collaboration when ending the session. One of the developers (preferably the session host) is responsible for committing and pushing the code.
